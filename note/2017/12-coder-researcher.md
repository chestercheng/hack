# Two Mindsets

Equations alone don't make computers work.

The mind that produces equations and that drives computers, however, work in different conditions.   A good engineering methodology brings the scientific mind closer to the programming mind, and results into readily applicable systems and results.

~~Obvious enough, isn't it?  When it comes to computational science, that simple fact oftentimes is considered in an interesting way.  Perhaps it's too obvious to be mentioned in any computational research paper, and the best treatment is a paragraph or a sentence for the existence of the code.~~
